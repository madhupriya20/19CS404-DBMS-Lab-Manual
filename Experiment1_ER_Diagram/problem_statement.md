# ER Diagram Workshop – Submission Template

## Objective
To understand and apply ER modeling concepts by creating ER diagrams for real-world applications.

## Purpose
Gain hands-on experience in designing ER diagrams that represent database structure including entities, relationships, attributes, and constraints.

# Scenario A: City Fitness Club Management

*Business Context:*  
FlexiFit Gym wants a database to manage its members, trainers, and fitness programs.

*Requirements:*  
- Members register with name, membership type, and start date.

### Entities and Attributes.
```

1.Members
   Name
   Contact number
   Address
2.Programs
   Type
   Duration
   Fees
3.Trainers
   Name
   Specialization
   Contact number
4.Payments
   Amount
   Payment Type
   Due Date
```

### Relationships and Constraints
```

1.Members — Joins → Programs
2.A member joins one or more programs.
3.Programs — Conducts → Trainers
4.Trainers conduct programs.
5.Trainers — Duty → Payments
6.Payments are associated with trainers’ duties.

```
### Assumptions
```

1.Every user must register as a member before accessing gym services.
2.A member has a unique contact number.
3.Each session or class is led by exactly one trainer.
4.Trainers can conduct multiple sessions but not at overlapping times.

   memb_name
   contact no.
   date
2.LOAN
   loan_date
   due_date
